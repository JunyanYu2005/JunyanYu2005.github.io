Hello. I am Junyan Yu, currently a senior undergraduate student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). I major in [Chinese Language and Literature](https://www.chi.cuhk.edu.hk/en/) and minor in [Linguistics](https://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/).

My academic training spans both traditional literary studies and contemporary linguistic theory. Through coursework and independent research, I have developed a strong interest in Chinese dialect grammar, syntax, and formal semantics. I am particularly interested in how fine-grained grammatical patterns - especially those found in regional varieties - contribute to broader theoretical questions in linguistic analysis.

With a background that integrates philological sensitivity and formal methodology, I aim to approach language as both a cultural-historical system and a structured cognitive system. My long-term goal is to pursue advanced research in Chinese linguistics, focusing on grammatical structure and its theoretical implications.

This website documents my academic work, research projects, and ongoing intellectual explorations. Sincerely appreciate your fleeting pause here in my realm of thoughts.
